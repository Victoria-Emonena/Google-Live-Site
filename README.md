<h1>Google Live Site</h1>
<p>
    A recreation of the Google Chrome whats-new webpage built with 
    <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong>. 
    The goal of this project is to practice modern frontend development techniques 
    and demonstrate clean, responsive UI design. <br>
    You can view the original webpage by typing <code>chrome://whats-new/</code> in your Google Chrome search bar. Please note that the content might look a little different as it is updated frequently by its        publishers but the layout should remain the same.
</p>
<h2>Project Structure</h2>
  <pre>
Google-Live-Site/
├── live site.html          # Main HTML file
├── src/                # raw Tailwind CSS input file and output file for compilation
├── output.css          # Compiled Tailwind CSS (linked in live site.html)
└── assets/         # Images and icons used
  </pre>

  <h2>How to View</h2>
  <p>
    No build step is required for viewing.  
    Simply clone the repository and open <code>live site.html</code> in your browser:
  </p>

  <pre>
git clone https://github.com/Victoria-Emonena/Google-Live-Site.git

    If you want to make changes to the styling using Tailwind CSS, you’ll need to recompile the CSS.
